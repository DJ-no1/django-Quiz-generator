# üöÄ Railway Deployment Fix

## ‚ùå Current Errors Fixed:
1. `DisallowedHost at /` - Invalid HTTP_HOST header
2. `Forbidden (403)` - CSRF verification failed

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix for Railway:

### **Option 1: Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard** (Recommended)

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add these environment variables:

```bash
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-#p=3h@bj%&4cd(^y8gh655ey8q_q^&tl+l_=pt70wjljc3sw8_
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDsafmVLoPv1MU9LyThO1vomC6beik9gh0
ALLOWED_HOSTS=web-production-6a99d.up.railway.app,*.railway.app
```

### **Option 2: Update settings.py for Railway** ‚úÖ **APPLIED**

Added Railway-specific settings to handle HTTPS and CSRF:

```python
# Railway specific settings
if 'RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT' in os.environ:
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']  # Allow all hosts on Railway
    DEBUG = False
    # CSRF settings for Railway
    CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['https://*.railway.app', 'https://web-production-6a99d.up.railway.app']
    SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
    SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False  # Railway handles SSL
```

## üîÑ After Making Changes:

1. **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Updated `settings.py` with Railway-specific CSRF and HTTPS settings
2. **üîÑ AUTO-DEPLOY**: Railway will automatically redeploy when you push changes  
3. **‚è≥ WAIT**: Give Railway 2-3 minutes to complete the deployment
4. **üß™ TEST**: Visit your Railway URL and try the "Generate Quiz" button

## üéØ Your Railway URL:
`https://web-production-6a99d.up.railway.app/`

## üõ†Ô∏è What We Fixed:
- ‚úÖ ALLOWED_HOSTS for Railway domain
- ‚úÖ CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS for HTTPS forms  
- ‚úÖ SSL proxy headers for Railway
- ‚úÖ Debug mode disabled in production

The **"Forbidden (403) CSRF verification failed"** error should now be completely resolved!
